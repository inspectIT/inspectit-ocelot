## inspectIT Ocelot Demo

If you would like to check inspectIT Ocelot in action with a demo application, you can use our docker compose example.
We use the distributed version of the [Spring PetClinic sample application](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices) as the target application in our demo.
To demonstrate the flexibility of the OpenCensus bases inspectIT agent, we provide different demo scenarios covering different monitoring and APM components.

All of the demo scenarios are fully configured with predefined dashboards, *so you can get started in 5 minutes*.

### Demo #1 - Prometheus, Grafana and Jaeger

Uses Prometheus Server for metrics gathering and storage, Grafana for Dashboards.
Traces are exported to Jaeger.
[See section below for detailed information](#prometheus-and-jaeger-scenario).

* File: `docker-compose-prometheus-jaeger.yml`
* [OpenAPM Landscape](https://openapm.io/landscape?agent=inspectit-ocelot-agent&instrumentation-lib=opencensus&collector=prometheus-server,jaeger-collector,inspectit-oce-eum-server&visualization=jaeger-query&dashboarding=grafana&usedges=inspectit-ocelot-agent:prometheus-server,inspectit-ocelot-agent:jaeger-collector,jaeger-query:grafana,inspectit-oce-eum-server:prometheus-server,inspectit-oce-eum-server:jaeger-collector&showCommercial=false&showFormats=false)

* File: `docker-compose-wavefront-zipkin.yml`

>Note: Before running the demo, you must add the Wavefront host and API token to the ```.env``` file in the ```inspectit-ocelot-demo```. Please add the following lines and change the cluster and token according to your Wavefront instance.
> ```
> WAVEFRONT_URL=https://<your cluster>.wavefront.com/api
> WAVEFRONT_TOKEN=<API token obtained from Wavefront>
> ```

## Launching the Demo

:::note
Currently, the demo is only available as Docker images for the AMD64 architecture.
On ARM platforms there may be problems with the execution.
:::

*Pre-requisites:* To launch the demo, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) needs to be installed on your system.
If you are using Docker for Windows or running Docker in a virtual machine, ensure that Docker has at least 4GB main memory assigned.

Either [download](https://github.com/inspectIT/inspectit-ocelot/archive/master.zip) or [clone the inspectit-Ocelot GitHub repository](https://github.com/inspectIT/inspectit-ocelot).

Change into the ```inspectit-ocelot-demo/``` directory and execute the following command to launch the desired demo scenario (replace [SCENARIO_POSTFIX] with the postfix of the scenario you would like to launch):

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-[SCENARIO_POSTFIX].yml up
```

This will start all the Docker containers required for the corresponding demo scenario, including the Petclinic demo application.

You can access the demo application (PetClinic) under http://localhost:8080.
Details on accessing monitoring infrastructure components are listed below, depending on the selected demo scenario.

### Starting the Demo on Windows Using WSL

If you want to execute the demo on Windows using the Windows subsystem for linux (WSL), you have to mount your hard drive to the WSL's root directory due to a problem of Docker for Windows and its volume mounting.

For example, mounting your C drive to the root file system can be achieved using the following commands:

```bash
sudo mkdir /c
sudo mount --bind /mnt/c /c
```

For more information, check out the following blog post: [Setting Up Docker for Windows and WSL to Work Flawlessly](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/setting-up-docker-for-windows-and-wsl-to-work-flawlessly)


## Demo Scenarios

> In all scenarios you can use `admin` as username and `demo` as password for accessing Grafana and the inspectIT Ocelot Configuration Server.

### Prometheus and Jaeger Scenario
In this scenario the following components are preconfigured and used for monitoring:

[![Demo scenario using Prometheus and Jaeger](assets/demo-landscape-prometheus-jaeger.png)](https://openapm.io/landscape?agent=inspectit-ocelot-agent&instrumentation-lib=opencensus&collector=prometheus-server%2Cjaeger-collector&dashboarding=grafana&visualization=jaeger-query)

- *inspectIT Ocelot agent:* Instruments all the target demo application components.

:::note
Currently, only the Beacons Dashboard is working for the InfluxDB and Zipkin scenario.
:::

### Wavefront Demo Scenario

Wavefront is a SaaS-based monitoring and tracing solution. In this demo, we are running a local proxy as a Docker container that is responsible for receiving Zipkin traces and sending them to Wavefront. We're also using Telegraf to poll the Prometheus endpoints on the monitored services and send that data to Wavefront through the proxy.

- *inspectIT Ocelot agent:* Instruments all the target demo application components.
- *Telegraf:* Polls the Prometheus metric endpoints on the services.
- *Wavefront Proxy:* Receives Zipkin traces and metrics (via Telegraf), aggregates, secures and compresses them before sending them to Wavefront.

A sandbox instance of Wavefront can be obtained here: https://www.wavefront.com/sign-up/

The inspectIT Ocelot Configuration Server can be accessed via http://localhost:8090.

## Demo Grafana Dashboards
The InfluxDB and Prometheus demo scenarios include the following predefined Grafana Dashboards:

### Agent
| Name + Grafana Marketplace | Description | Screenshot|

| Trace Controller | Shows metrics for the number of processed traces, the number of spans and the average processing times for the traces| [![](assets/demo-dashboard-trace-controller_small.png)](assets/demo-dashboard-trace-controller.png)|

## Changing Agent Configurations

In all demo scenarios the inspectIT Ocelot agents already have their service names and used ports as well as a basic instrumentation set up.
Each scenario uses the *inspectIT Ocelot Configuration Server* for managing and providing the configuration files to the agents.
The web UI of the configuration server can be accessed via [localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090).

The demo starts the following services, of which each is instrumented with an inspectIT Ocelot Agent:

- *config-server*
- *discovery-server*
- *customers-service*
- *visits-service*
- *vets-service*
- *api-gateway*


## Load Test

All demo scenarios launch with a load test written in [artillery](https://artillery.io/) that simulates user behavior. For 10 minutes approximately every 3 seconds a new virtual user is created which either looks up a random owner from the database or edits the pet type of an existing animal. Therefore no real user interaction with the PetClinic is needed.
