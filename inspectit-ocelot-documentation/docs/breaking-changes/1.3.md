## Changed Trace Attributes Behaviour

In previous version it was possible to write [trace attributes](instrumentation/rules.md#adding-attributes)
without actually starting a span in the same method. In this case, attributes would be written to a parent method which was traced.
This could sometimes lead to a surprising behaviour and therefore has been removed.

This behaviour can still be realized if desired via [data propagation](instrumentation/rules.md#data-propagation).

## Reworked Default Agent Configuration

The default configuration of the agent has completely been reworked.
This means that in case your custom instrumentation is based on existing scopes, actions or rules it might stop working.
In order to fix this it is required to adapt your instrumentation to the new default configuration.
