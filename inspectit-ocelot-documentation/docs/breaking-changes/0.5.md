title: Breaking changes in 0.5
---

This section discusses the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating your inspectIT Ocelot components to version 0.5.

## Change of the configuration server's configuration prefix

Until now, all components used the configuration prefix `inspectit` for the inspectIT Ocelot specific configuration settings.
This often led to confusion because, especially in examples, it was not clear to which component a particular setting belonged.
To avoid confusion between the configurations of different components the configuration prefix of the configuration server has been changed to `inspectit-config-server`.

The configuration server will not load the configuration if it is still located under the `inspectit` prefix.
