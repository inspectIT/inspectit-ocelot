title: Agent Mappings
---

Agent mappings are used to determine which agent receives which configuration. Here, individual files or specific 
folders can be defined, which serve as the basis for the resulting configuration. 
Furthermore, you can specify which branch (`WORKSPACE` or `LIVE`) the mapping should use to obtain the configuration files.

It's important to note that the first matching agent mapping will be used to determine which configuration is shipped to an agent.
Additional agent mappings which may also match the attributes list sent by an agent will be ignored.
See section [HTTP-based Configuration](configuration/external-configuration-sources.md#http-based-configuration) for
information on how to specify which attributes will be sent by an agent.

An agent mapping consists of the following properties:

| Property | Default | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | - | The name of the agent mapping. |
| `sources` | `[]` | A list of paths. All configuration files matching this list (Directories are resolved recursively) will be merged together and returned to matching agents. |
| `attributes` | `{}` | A map of attributes. This map is used to determine whether an agent will match this agent mapping, thus, get its configuration. |
| `sourceBranch` | `WORKSPACE` | Defines which branch is used as source for the configuration files. Supported values are: `WORKSPACE`, `LIVE` |


The configuration server is shipped with a default agent mapping.
This default agent mapping maps each agent to each configuration file of the `workspace` branch.

```YAML
- name: "Default Mapping"
  sources:
  - "/"
  attributes:
    service: ".*"
  sourceBranch: "WORKSPACE"
```

## Git Staging

:::tip
You can find more detailed information about file staging and promotion [here](config-server/files-staging.md).
:::

Since the version `2.5.7` the configuration for the agent mappings itself will also be included into the git staging. For all agent mappings 
the configuration is stored in one file. After one or several agent mappings have been edited, the changes will also
appear on the promotion page. The promotion of the agent mappings configuration works directly like the promotion of agent configuration files.

Additionally, it is possible to select a source branch (`WORKSPACE` or `LIVE`) for the agent mappings configuration itself. 
This will determine, whether changes in the agent mappings should be applied directly or only after the promotion of the 
agent mappings configuration.

:::important
The source branch for the agent mappings configuration will **not affect** the defined `sourceBranch` in each **individual agent mapping**!
The `sourceBranch` property of an individual agent mapping determines, which branch should be used for the agent configuration files.
:::

![Different Source Branches on Agent Mappings Page](assets/agent_mappings_source_branch.png)

You can define, which source branch should be used at start-up for the agent mappings
in the application properties of the configuration server:

```YAML
inspectit-config-server:
  initial-agent-mappings-source-branch: WORKSPACE
```

## Example Agent Mappings

### Example 1

The following agent mapping will deliver all promoted configuration files located in the directory `/common` and `/europe/west` to all agents whose `region` attributes is equal to `eu-west`.

```YAML
- name: "Example Mapping 1"
  sources:
  - "/common"
  - "/europe/west"
  attributes:
    service: ".*"
    region: "eu-west"
  sourceBranch: "LIVE"
```

### Example 2

The following agent mapping will deliver all configuration files located in the directory `/common` and the specific file `/special/customer-service.yml` of the `workspace` branch to all agents whose `service` attributes is equal to `customer-service`.

```YAML
- name: "Example Mapping 2"
  sources:
  - "/common"
  - "/special/customer-service.yml"
  attributes:
    service: "customer-service"
  sourceBranch: "WORKSPACE"
```
