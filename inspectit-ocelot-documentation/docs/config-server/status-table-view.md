| Marked Buttons explained |   |

|![Status Table View](assets/service-states-btn.png)|Here the current services (e.g. Prometheus, Jaeger, Influx, Log-Preloading, Agent Command Service, ...) and their current state enabled/disabled are being displayed. In the future it should be as easy as pressing a button to enable/disable a service.|
|![Status Table View](assets/logs-btn.png)|When the agent commands and the log preloading are activated, the logs of the service are being shown here.|
|![Status Table View](assets/config-btn.png)|When the agent commands are activated, the current config in yaml format is being shown here.|
|![Status Table View](assets/download-archive-btn.png)|When the agent commands and the log preloading are activated, you can download the support archive as a .zip file here, containing logs, config and environment details.|
