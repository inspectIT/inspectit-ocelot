/**
 * This event represents the start of an instrumented and traced method.
 * If a method is traced normally within a trace with stack trace sampling enabled,
 * special handling is required. The parent span of the method might need to be changed when the stack-trace samples are analyzed.
 * <p>
 * For this reason, no normal span is created for such methods, instead a {@link PlaceholderSpan} is used which never actually gets exported.
 * A placeholder-span however does reserve a span-id (so for example trace-id-propagation works correctly).
 * <p>
 * Every {@link MethodEntryEvent} also has a {@link MethodExitEvent} which together define the duration of the method call.
