            Conditionally captures the execution time of the current method into method_duration.
            The capturing will only happen if capture_time_condition is defined as true.
            For example, http instrumentation define capture_time_condition based on http_is_entry.
            The condition is there to prevent unnecessary invocations of System.nanoTime(), which can be expensive.
