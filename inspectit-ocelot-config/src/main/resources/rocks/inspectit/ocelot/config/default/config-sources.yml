  config:

    # file based configuration - has the highest priority
    # loads all .yaml/yml and .properties files in alphabetical order from the given path
    # is active when path is not empty or null and enabled is set to true
    file-based:
      # the path to the directory to scan for configuration files
      # scanning happens recursive meaning that subdirectories will be parsed
      path:
      # can be used to disable the file based configuration while the path is still specified
      enabled: true
      # if true the directory will be watched for changes. When changes occur, the configuration is automatically reloaded
      watch: true
      # The frequency at which the target folder should be polled for changes if 'watch' is true.
      frequency: 5s

    # http property source configuration - has a lower priority than file-based configuration
