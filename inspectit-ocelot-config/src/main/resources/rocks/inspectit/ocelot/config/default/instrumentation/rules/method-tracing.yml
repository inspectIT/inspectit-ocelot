          description: |-
            This rule records the current method as a span.
            In addition, the FQN of the method is added as a tag and the error status is set based on if the method threw an exception
          
            This rule can be either included or scopes can be directly added to it.
        include:
          'r_tracing_global_attributes': true
        tracing:
          start-span: true
          error-status: _thrown
