== Introduction

inspectIT OpenCensus Edition is a spin-off from the original https://github.com/inspectIT/inspectIT[inspectIT] APM project.
Unlike the original inspectIT version, this edition provides only a Java agent that is built on top of the OpenCensus implementation, without any other components or dependencies.

Open source APM tools have significantly improved in the past few years and instrumentation libraries like OpenCensus, openTracing, Zipkin, Jaeger, micrometer, etc have gained a lot of popularity.
The main problem that inspectIT OCE tries to solve is the time needed to introduce these instrumentation libraries in already active projects.
As these libraries require source code changes, a lot of companies that would like to move away from commercial APM solutions are facing a problem that now they need to change the code in hundreds of projects.
The required changes can turn out to be more expensive than actually keeping the commercial tool(s).

The inspectIT OCE agent uses Java byte-code manipulation to set up the OpenCensus instrumentation library with zero-configuration and requires no source-code changes.
Furthermore, inspectIT OCE instruments your application so that most important metrics are automatically monitored and traces are collected and propagated as well.
This allows DevOps teams to start collecting performance data about their Java applications in seconds.

The decision to base the agent on the OpenCensus implementation was made because of the flexibility that OpenCensus provides with respect to where the collected data can be exported and stored.
The OpenCensus offers multiple https://opencensus.io/exporters[exporters for Java] (Prometheus, Zipkin, Jaeger, etc) and the inspectIT OCE supports them all.
Thus, combining different open source tools you can come to the desired APM solution based on open source software only, as the https://openapm.io/landscape?agent=inspectit-oce-agent&instrumentation-lib=opencensus&collector=jaeger-collector,zipkin-server,prometheus-server&visualization=jaeger-query,zipkin-server&dashboarding=grafana[openapm.io] landscape shows below:

It's important to mention that inspectIT OCE seamlessly integrates with the OpenCensus library if one is used in your application.
The data collected by your manual source code instrumentation will be combined with everything that the agent collects as well.
