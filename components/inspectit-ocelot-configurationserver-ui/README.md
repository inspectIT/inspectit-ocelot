# inspectIT Ocelot - Configuration Server UI

This is the web-frontend for the inspectIT Ocelot configuration server.

## How to

### Developing

Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) on your system.

After that install all dependencies using yarn:
```bash
yarn
```

Using the following command, a development server can be started which serves the frontend and provides useful features like hot-reloading (changes will be immediatly updated in the browser - no refresh is required).
```bash
yarn dev
```

The development server can be reached at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Linting

Depending on your IDE, linting errors based on the settings in .eslintrc can be shown right in your editor.
However, if that is not the case with your IDE you can use the following command to check for linting errors.
```bash
yarn lint
```

And the following to fix them automatically.
```bash
yarn lint:fix
```

#### Storybook

The project also contains [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) which supports the development of components by providing an isolated sandbox UI for testing these components.

Storybook can be started using the following command
```bash
yarn storybook
```

### Exporting

The frontend can be built and exported using the following command - the `build` task is included in the `export` task.

```bash
yarn export
```

The exported page will be located in the `out` directory.
